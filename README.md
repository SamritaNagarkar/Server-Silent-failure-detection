# Silent Failure / Value Decay Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict early signs of customer value decay before churn occurs.
Instead of reacting to churn, the model identifies subtle behavioral changes that
indicate declining engagement and future revenue risk.

## Business Problem
Companies often detect customer issues too late. By the time churn happens,
the opportunity to intervene is gone. This project focuses on early warning signals
that indicate silent loss of customer value.

## Goal
Build a predictive system that flags users entering a value decay phase
using historical behavioral data.

## Status
Project setup and problem definition (in progress)
